                <h2>How to Build a RAG Agent</h2>
                <p class="lead">A Comprehensive Guide</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
                <div class="col-lg-10">
                    <div class="feature-single-box">
                        <p>Building a powerful RAG agent involves two primary workflows: document processing to create a searchable knowledge base and a retrieval system to interact with it. This article details the steps to set up both workflows using tools like Google Drive, Pinecone, and OpenAI.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Part 1: Document Processing and Pre-processing</h4>
                        <p>This workflow prepares your data, transforming a simple document into a structured knowledge base that your agent can query.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Create Your Knowledge Base:</strong> The first step is to compile all the information you want your RAG agent to access into a single file, such as a PDF or text document. The video uses a Q&A format from a photography website's FAQ page as an example.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Upload to Google Drive:</strong> Upload the prepared document to a designated folder in your Google Drive. This acts as the source for your data and allows for future updates to be automatically incorporated into your RAG agent.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Connect Google Drive and Download the File:</strong> To connect your workflow to Google Drive, you'll need to use the Google Cloud Console. Create a new project, enable the Google Drive API, and generate an OAuth 2.0 Client ID to get the necessary credentials (client ID and client secret). These credentials will securely link your workflow to your Google Drive. Once connected, add a "Download a file" step to ensure your document is retrieved for processing.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Connect Pinecone Credentials:</strong> Pinecone is a vector database that will store the vectorized versions of your document. Create a new index in Pinecone, giving it a descriptive name (e.g., wolf-head-ai-rag). You'll also need to select an appropriate embedding model, such as text-embedding-small-openai, and use your Pinecone API keys to connect it to your workflow.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Connect OpenAI Credentials:</strong> An embedding model is essential for converting text into numerical vectors that the RAG agent can understand and process. Add your OpenAI API key to the workflow and select a compatible embedding model like text-embedding-3-small.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Text Splitting and Processing:</strong> This crucial step breaks down your large document into smaller, manageable chunks. The video recommends using a Recursive Character Text Splitter with a chunk size of 500 characters and an overlap of 200 characters. This allows the agent to search for specific information more efficiently without needing to analyze the entire document at once.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Part 2: The Retrieval Workflow</h4>
                        <p>This workflow is the "brains" of your RAG agent, handling user queries and retrieving relevant information from your knowledge base.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Create a New Workflow:</strong> Set up a new, separate workflow dedicated to the retrieval process.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Add a Chat Trigger:</strong> The chat trigger is the entry point for user queries. This node receives questions from a user and can be linked to various platforms like Telegram or WhatsApp.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Add an AI Agent and a Chat Model:</strong> Add an "AI Agent" node and connect it to a reliable LLM (Large Language Model) like GPT-4 mini. This LLM will process the user's query and the retrieved information to formulate a response.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Add a Simple Memory:</strong> To enable the agent to maintain context throughout a conversation, add a "Simple Memory" node with a recommended context window length of five. This allows the agent to recall previous questions and answers.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Add Pinecone as a Tool:</strong> The Pinecone vector store you created earlier is now added as a "tool" for the AI agent. This allows the agent to access and search your knowledge base. You'll need to specify a descriptive name and a clear description of the tool's function, such as "Retrieves data when the user asks for relevant data about Wolf Head headshot photography services."</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Add an Embedding Model:</strong> Finally, connect the same embedding model (text-embedding-3-small) to this retrieval workflow. This ensures that user queries are also converted into vectors, allowing the agent to perform an efficient similarity search against the vectorized knowledge base in Pinecone.</p>
                        
                        <p>Once both workflows are complete, your RAG agent is ready to be tested! It can now receive a user query, search your knowledge base for relevant information, and provide a well-structured answer.</p>
